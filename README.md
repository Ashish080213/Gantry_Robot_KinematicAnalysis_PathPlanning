The forward kinematic analysis of the gantry robot is investigated. Programming for the IGUS Gantry robot is done  using C-prog which simplifies Gantry Robot Kinematic Analysis.



The forward kinematic analysis of the gantry robot is investigated. The Gantry model is 
prepared and solved for positioning of the end-effectors using a Robo analyzer based on the 
D.H Method and now it is become easy to study the kinematic of the gantry robot and 
changing the parameters to see the behavior of the system for getting the best design and 
configuration of the robot. Furthermore, programming for the IGUS Gantry robot is done 
using C-prog which simplifies Gantry Robot Kinematic Analysis.
