# Gantry_Robot_KinematicAnalysis_PathPlanning

In the present project, kinematic analysis is done 
using ROBOANALYZER software to find out the position of the tool or end effector for 
different and joint variables and we use CPRog Software for programming the Gantry Robot
Kinematics.

The forward kinematic analysis of the gantry robot is investigated. Programming for the IGUS Gantry robot is done  using C-prog which simplifies Gantry Robot Kinematic Analysis.



The Gantry model is prepared and solved for positioning of the end-effectors using a Robo analyzer based on the 
D.H Method and now it is become easy to study the kinematic of the gantry robot and 
changing the parameters to see the behavior of the system for getting the best design and 
configuration of the robot.
